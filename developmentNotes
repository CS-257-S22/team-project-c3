IN FORNT END .PY THE MULTIPRODUCT THREAD/ROUTE WHERE IT'S RENDER TEMPLATE. PRODUCTS= FOO NEEDS TO BE AN ACTUAL THING! 

make another page that is from brands
pass to the template and get things from the result of the users 
through that way we will be able to pass things around and save anything in the python side 

RESOLVED - Current confusion (Morgan): I am having a hard time getting the brand dropdown form to submit the brand and product name
to the productInfo page. I have been poking around trying to figure out the POST/GET stuff and using global variables in
the front_end, but I am getting confused and unhelpful errors. 

Add in return and parameters (ALMOST DONE @ALICE)

On the productInfo page, the product variable includes all of the products of the given brand, it should 
only include the product being referenced.

On the productInfo page it needs to display the ingredients - it looks like the product is not being passed into
datasource getIngredients.

Ensure footer is the same on all pages

Edge case: if user hits enter and submits a string that is not a product in the dataset

Remove the ASCII character values from data entries (those on the inside)

Make thedatabse update correctly

CSS isn't doing what I want it to.

How should we deal with case in the search bar. Could we make everything in the database capital and then convert the user's input into 
all caps?
