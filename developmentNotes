IN FORNT END .PY THE MULTIPRODUCT THREAD/ROUTE WHERE IT'S RENDER TEMPLATE. PRODUCTS= FOO NEEDS TO BE AN ACTUAL THING! 

make another page that is from brands
pass to the template and get things from the result of the users 
through that way we will be able to pass things around and save anything in the python side 

Current confusion (Morgan): I am having a hard time getting the brand dropdown form to submit the brand and product name
to the productInfo page. I have been poking around trying to figure out the POST/GET stuff and using global variables in
the front_end, but I am getting confused and unhelpful errors. 

Add in return and parameters (ALMOST DONE @ALICE)
